# A time series analysis about the crime in Puerto Rico from the year 2007 to 2014

## Overview

Crime Pattern Detection is one of the many applications of data mining, and it
deals with the study and analysis of crimes using data. As you might think, 
detecting a pattern, or even worse, predicting them is something that might seem 
taken from a movie. However it is a real application of data mining, and there 
are many research groups working on that.

In this report I will introduce the concept of time series analysis using the R base
package to inspect the assassination history of Puerto Rico from 2007 to 2014.

## The data

This report's dataset features the total amount of murders that happened in Puerto
Rico during the period 2007 - 2014. This data is divided by months and years. 

## Repository

This repo is made of 3 files (besides the README.md): The markdown script, which holds the code and the report, an R file with just the code, and the dataset.
